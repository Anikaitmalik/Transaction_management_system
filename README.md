<h1>Tranasction Management System</h1>

<h3>1. Introduction :</h3>

Built an interactive command line software for a small business to track and manage its transactions using Python tools like Pandas and SQLite3 Embedded with features like accepting returns, generating receipts for each transaction, managing staff members and a search engine to look for items in the store inventory

<h3>2.Main Script working :</h3>

Initializes variables, connects to a SQLite database, and reads necessary tables (inventory, sales_staff, admin, purchase_history).
Determines the user type (regular or admin) and enters a loop to prompt user actions based on selected menu options.
Continues until the user chooses to exit.

<h3>3.Database Interaction :</h3>

Saves the updated inventory, staff, admin, and purchase history tables back to the SQLite database


Overall, this script serves as a functional system for managing inventory, processing sales, handling returns, and generating reports for a small-scale retail operation. It demonstrates the use of Python along with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, as well as interaction with a SQLite database.
